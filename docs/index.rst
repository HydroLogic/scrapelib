===================

Overview
--------
scrapelib is a library that at its simplest provides a replacement for urllib2's urlopen functionality but can do much more.

Advantages of using scrapelib over urllib2 or httplib2 include:

* HTTP, HTTPS, FTP requests via an identical API
* HTTP caching, compression, and cookies
* intelligent and configurable redirect following
* request throtting
* configurable retries for non-permanent failures
* robots.txt compliance
* robust error handling
